# Freshops CLI v1.0



## What is this? 

This is a cli tool that can be run on any codebase of ours to document project metadata at different levels such as 

1. Technical Fundamentals
2. Security Practices 
3. Reliability
4. Maintenance
5. Usability 

## Why should we use this? 

1. all projects have a baseline reliable and vetted spec to refer to 
2. improve overall quality of our apps and delivery
3. avoid human oversight 
4. enrich and transmit knowledge easily 
5. smooth operations

## What is the ROI? 

1. Time - Invest time in discovering and enriching spec instead of revisiting same problems
2. Quality - Assured Standard for all projects at set minimum of a spec
3. Speed & Clarity - Baseline reference enables bringing projects to speed easily
4. Security - Avoid risking project security by LCD philosophy
